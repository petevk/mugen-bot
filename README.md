To get running, first have python3 installed.
Then, make sure you have virtualenv installed (usually pip install virtualenv).
`virtualenv -p /path/to/python3/executable venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
Now, `which python` should point to a local version and it should be python3.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To leave this virtual environment, type `deactivate`.
